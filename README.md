## Introduction

Large-scale Vision-Language (V-L) models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the input text prompts, and full fine-tuning is often impractical due to massive model sizes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. While prompt learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient alternative, existing methods primarily focus on the language branch, which is a suboptimal approach.

This project addresses these challenges, particularly in the context of satellite imagery where data is often sensitive and distributed. Centralized training in such scenarios is frequently not feasible, making a strong case for privacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning (FL).

## Our Contribution

To tackle the limitations of unimodal prompting, we introduce **DualPrompt**, a novel method with the following key contributions:

1.  **Dual-Prompting**: We introduce learnable prompts in **both** the vision and language branches of the V-L model, allowing for dynamic, multi-modal adaptation.
2.  **Strong Coupling Mechanism**: Our design promotes synergy between the vision and language prompts through a bidirectional information sharing mechanism and coupled context optimization.
3.  **Federated Learning Integration**: We successfully adapt and evaluate DualPrompt in a federated learning setting, demonstrating its viability for decentralized and privacy-preserving training on sensitive satellite imagery.

## Methodology

### Dual-Prompting Mechanism

The core of DualPrompt is the introduction of learnable prompts, $\mathbf{P}_i$ (language) and $\mathbf{Q}_i$ (vision), at alternating layers of the V-L model's encoders.

-   **Bidirectional Prompt Sharing**: Information from the language prompts is projected and injected into the vision branch, and vice-versa, creating a tight coupling.
-   **Coupled Context Optimization**: Learnable context prompts in each branch are conditioned on each other via dedicated coupling functions (linear layers).
-   **Parameter-Efficiency**: We keep the pretrained model backbone frozen and only update the prompts, normalization layers, and a few lightweight coupling and attention layers.
-   **Compound Loss**: Our training objective is a combination of a standard cross-entropy classification loss and a cosine similarity-based alignment loss to ensure the vision and language representations remain aligned.

$$L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{cls}} + \lambda_{\text{align}} L_{\text{align}}$$

### Federated Learning Setup

We implement DualPrompt in a federated environment using a variant of the FedAvg algorithm.

1.  **Initialization**: A central server initializes the global learnable parameters ($\theta_g^0$).
2.  **Distribution**: The server sends the current global model to a set of clients.
3.  **Local Training**: Each client trains the model on its local, private data for a few epochs.
4.  **Aggregation**: The server aggregates the updated parameters from the clients to create a new global model. This process is repeated for a set of communication rounds.

This setup ensures that the raw data never leaves the client's device, thus preserving privacy.

## Key Results

We evaluated DualPrompt in both centralized and federated settings, primarily in a challenging 16-shot learning scenario.
